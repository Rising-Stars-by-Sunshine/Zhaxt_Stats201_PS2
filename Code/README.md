## Machine Learning Method: Linear Regression
Linear regression can be a useful method for predicting stock prices in time series due to its simplicity, interpretability, and ability to capture linear relationships between independent variables and stock values. The model provides clear insights into the impact of individual features on stock prices through interpretable coefficients, making it valuable for identifying key factors influencing market movements. Linear regression is computationally efficient, allowing for quick training and real-time predictions, and serves as a baseline model for comparison with more complex algorithms. While acknowledging its limitations in capturing nonlinearities and complex patterns, linear regression's straightforward nature makes it a practical starting point for time series prediction, especially when the underlying trends in stock prices exhibit linearity over shorter time intervals.
